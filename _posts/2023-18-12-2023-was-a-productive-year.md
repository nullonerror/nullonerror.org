  2023 was a productive year.
---

The year started and I joined [Fueled](https://fueled.com/), an agency specializing in mobile apps and web systems, as a lead engineer.

At Fueled, so far I've had the opportunity to work with three of their biggest clients to date. One of them is the world's most famous lingerie brand, for which I developed a 'social network' that currently has about 1 million users. Then, I worked on a credit platform for elders in the United States that garnered 500,000 users at launch. Currently, I am working on a personal time management project for one of the top coaches in the field.

In parallel, I wrote five articles for Fueled's technical blog. They are:

- [Working With Compressed Binary Data on AWS Iot Core](https://fueled.com/the-cache/posts/backend/working-with-compressed-binary-data-on-aws-iot-core/)
- [Combating Telegram Spam With a Serverless Bot](https://fueled.com/the-cache/posts/backend/combating-telegram-spam-with-a-serverless-bot/)
- [Clean Architecture with FastAPI](https://fueled.com/the-cache/posts/backend/clean-architecture-with-fastapi/)
- [Secure Cloud Workspace with VSCode and Tailscale](https://fueled.com/the-cache/posts/backend/devops/cloud-workspace/)
- [Lint all the things with golangci-lint!](https://fueled.com/the-cache/posts/backend/golang/lint-all-the-things-with-golangci-lint/)

I also wrote another five for my personal blog (this one). They are:

- [Gotta go fast with Docker on macOS](https://nullonerror.org/2023/01/19/gotta-go-fast-with-docker-on-macos/)
- [Working with compressed binary data on AWS IoT Core](https://nullonerror.org/2023/10/17/working-with-compressed-binary-data-on-aws-iot-core/)
- [What I've been automating with GitHub Actions, an automated life](https://nullonerror.org/2023/11/01/what-i-ve-been-automating-with-github-actions-an-automated-life/)
- [Flipping Bits Whilst Updating Pixels](https://nullonerror.org/2023/11/12/flipping-bits-whilst-updating-pixels/)
- [Executing Untrusted Code in Serverless Environments: A Telegram Bot for Running C and C++ Code on Cloud Run](https://nullonerror.org/2023/12/01/executing-untrusted-code-in-serverless-environments-a-telegram-bot-for-running-c-and-c++-code-on-cloud-run/)

As if that wasn't enough, I also developed and maintained personal projects, one of which, [Carimbo](https://github.com/flippingpixels/carimbo), was the one I devoted most of my time to. They are:

- [Carimbo](https://github.com/flippingpixels/carimbo) - A 2D engine written in C++ using SDL and Lua as a scripting language.
- [Carimbo Play](https://github.com/flippingpixels/play) - A web server to serve a combination of Carimbo releases and games.
- [Grammateus](https://github.com/skhaz/grammateus) - An assistant that summarizes Twitch streams using OpenAI, written in Go.
- [Neo Compiler Bot](https://github.com/skhaz/neo-compiler-and-runner) - A Telegram bot capable of compiling and executing unsafe code in the cloud.
- [Freudian Slip Bot](https://github.com/skhaz/freudian-slip) - A bot designed to detect slip-ups between the lines.

And many other small projects.

As a result.

Let's see if 2024 will surpass it. Happy new year everyone!
