### TL;DR

After a while, I decided to resume work on [my game engine](https://github.com/carimbolabs/carimbo).

I made a game for my son. I could have used an existing engine, but I chose to write everything from scratch because code is like pasta‚Äîit‚Äôs much better and more enjoyable when homemade.

This actually reminds me of when my father used to build my toys, from kites to wooden slides. Good memories. I have decided to do the same using what I know: programming.

You can watch it here or [play it here](https://play.carimbo.cloud/1.0.10/carimbolabs/megarick/1.0.7/720p), (runs in the browser thanks to WebAssembly), use `A` and `D` for moving around and `space` to shoot.

The engine was written in C++17, and the games are in Lua. The engine exposes some primitives to the Lua VM, which in turn coordinates the entire game.

### Going Deep

The entire game is scripted in Lua.

First, we create the engine itself.

```lua
local engine = EngineFactory.new()
    :set_title("Mega Rick")
    :set_width(1920)
    :set_height(1080)
    :set_fullscreen(false)
    :create()
```

Then we point to some resources for asset prefetching; they are loaded lazily to avoid impacting the game loop.

```lua
engine:prefetch({
  "blobs/bomb1.ogg",
  "blobs/bomb2.ogg",
  "blobs/bullet.png",
  "blobs/candle.png",
  "blobs/explosion.png",
  "blobs/octopus.png",
  "blobs/player.png",
  "blobs/princess.png",
  "blobs/ship.png"
})
```

We created the postal service, which is something I borrowed from languages like Erlang, where an entity can send messages to any other. As we‚Äôll see below, the bullet sends a hit message when it collides with the octopus, and the octopus, upon receiving the hit, decrements its own health.

We also obtain the SoundManager to play sounds and spawn the main entities.

```lua
local postal = PostalService.new()
local soundmanager = engine:soundmanager()
local octopus = engine:spawn("octopus")
local player = engine:spawn("player")
local princess = engine:spawn("princess")
local candle1 = engine:spawn("candle")
local candle2 = engine:spawn("candle")
```

It‚Äôs not a triple-A title, but I‚Äôm very careful with resource management. A widely known technique is to create an object pool that you can reuse. In the code below, we limit it to a maximum of 3 bullets present on the screen.

The on_update method is a callback called each loop in the engine. In the case of the bullet, I check if it has approached the green octopus. If so, I send a message to it indicating that it received a hit.

```lua
for _ = 1, 3 do
  local bullet = engine:spawn("bullet")
  bullet:set_placement(-128, -128)
  bullet:on_update(function(self)
    if self.x > 1200 then
      postal:post(Mail.new(0, "bullet", "hit")) -- id 0 is the octopus
      bullet:unset_action()
      bullet:set_placement(-128, -128) -- move to ouside the screen
      table.insert(bullet_pool, bullet) -- back to the pool
    end
  end)
  table.insert(bullet_pool, bullet)
end
```

On the octopus‚Äôs side, when it receives a ‚Äúhit‚Äù message, the entity triggers an explosion animation, switches to attack mode, and decreases its health by 1. If it reaches 0, it changes the animation to ‚Äúdead‚Äù.

```lua
octopus:set_action("idle")
octopus:set_placement(1200, 620)
octopus:on_mail(function(self, message)
  if message == 'hit' then
    bomb()
    octopus:set_action("attack")
    life = life - 1
    if life <= 0 then
      self:set_action("dead")
    end
  end
end)
```

And finally, the player‚Äôs `on_update`, where I apply the velocity if any movement keys are pressed, or set the animation to idle if none are pressed.

We also have the projectile firing, where the fire function is called, taking an instance of a bullet from the pool, placing it in a semi-random position, and applying velocity.

```lua
local function fire()
  if #bullet_pool > 0 then
    local bullet = table.remove(bullet_pool)
    local x = (player.x + player.size.width) - 30
    local y = player.y + 30
    local offset_y = (math.random(-2, 2)) * 20

    bullet:set_placement(x, y + offset_y)
    bullet:set_velocity(Vector2D.new(0.6, 0))
    bullet:set_action("default")

    local sound = "bomb" .. math.random(1, 2)
    soundmanager:play(sound)
  end
end

player:on_update(function(self)
  local velocity = Vector2D.new(0, 0)

  if engine:is_keydown(KeyEvent.space) then
    if not shooting then
      fire()
      shooting = true
    end
  else
    shooting = false
  end

  if engine:is_keydown(KeyEvent.a) then
    velocity.x = -.4
  elseif engine:is_keydown(KeyEvent.d) then
    velocity.x = .4
  end

  if velocity:moving() then
    self:set_action("run")
    if velocity:left() then
      self:set_flip(Flip.horizontal)
    else
      self:set_flip(Flip.none)
    end
  elseif velocity:zero() then
    self:set_action("idle")
  end

  self:set_velocity(velocity)
end)
```

### In The End

In the end, he requested some _minor_ tweaks, such as the projectile being the princess sprite, the target being the player, and the entity that shoots being the green octopus. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
